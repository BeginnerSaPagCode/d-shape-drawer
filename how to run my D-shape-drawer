You can run my code like in usual Vscode program, after you run it there will be an pop up saying "shape drawer"]
and press to draw, after you press it you can start drawing the shape you want and delete it after you draw but 
after you you draw and draw another shape the previous shape cant be delete so think first if the shape you draw is 
correct and after that you can save the shape that you drawing to your files and you can also load your files that
you save buy pressing load. although my code is not perfect like when you draw polygon you cant shape it or adjust 
the size
